    // Applying to specific controllers or routes
    @Controller('auth')
    @UseGuards(ThrottlerGuard)
    @Throttle({ default: { limit: 5, ttl: 60 } }) // More restrictive for auth routes
    export class AuthController {
      // Routes protected by rate limiting
    }

    // Using more advanced rate-limiter-flexible features
    // services/custom-rate-limiter.service.ts
    import { RateLimiterRedis } from 'rate-limiter-flexible';
    import Redis from 'ioredis';

    @Injectable()
    export class CustomRateLimiterService {
      private readonly limiter: RateLimiterRedis;

      constructor(configService: ConfigService) {
        const redisClient = new Redis(configService.get('REDIS_URL'));

        this.limiter = new RateLimiterRedis({
          storeClient: redisClient,
          keyPrefix: 'login_limit',
          points: 5, // Number of attempts
          duration: 60 * 60, // 1 hour in seconds
          blockDuration: 60 * 15, // Block for 15 minutes after exceeding
        });
      }

      async loginAttempt(ip: string): Promise<boolean> {
        try {
          await this.limiter.consume(ip);
          return true; // Not blocked
        } catch (error) {
          // Rate limit exceeded
          return false; // Blocked
        }
      }
    }
    ```
